Project Title: Analysis of PhonePe Pulse Data (Q1 2018 â€“ Q2 2021)
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis of digital transaction data sourced from PhonePe Pulse, spanning from the first quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2021. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, multiple datasets have been loaded from an Excel file, including transaction data by state and district, user statistics, device distribution, and demographic insights.

The goal is to derive meaningful insights by:

Understanding usage trends across states and districts.

Analyzing transaction volumes, values, and user engagement.

Exploring the distribution of device types and demographic factors impacting digital payment adoption.

This analysis can help uncover regional usage patterns and highlight the digital payment growth trajectory in India during the specified period.# Phone-pay-Python
